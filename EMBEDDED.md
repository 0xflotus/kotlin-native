# Embedded hardware support in Kotlin/Native compiler

Kotlin/Native allows programming for a range of embedded hardware boards.

As a preconfigured example, we provide support for an entry level 32 bit ARM `STM32f4 Discovery` board.
Other embedded hardware can be configured using configurable targets mechanism.

## Configurable compiler targets for specific boards.

To avoid cluttering the list of supported targets, Kotlin/Native provides
what we call _configurable targets_. 

Users can introduce their own variants of predefined target templates.
To define needed nuances, such as instruction set variant or ABI nuances for particular hardware.

As of now we provide a single target template for [Zephyr project](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) embedded operating system.

See `konan/platforms/zephyr/stm32f4_disco` in the installation for example of Zephyr 
target template configured for particular `STM32f4 Discovery` board.

A tweaked template instance for your board, say, `myboard` can be placed into `~/.konan/platforms/zephyr/myboard` and the compiler target `zephyr_myboard` will become available.


## Example of using Kotlin/Native for embedded.

We provide a sample program blinking a LED on a `STM32f4 Discovery` board under control
of `Zephyr` in `samples/zephyr` directory in Kotlin/Native installation.

You need to install `Zephyr project` on your host system somewhere.

Note that we provide Kotlin bindings for the C interfaces of Zephyr (`zephyr.h`, `device.h` etc) autogenerated.
